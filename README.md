This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## End-to-End Testing

This project includes end-to-end (E2E) testing with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). The tests are located in the `e2e` directory.

To run the tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Run tests with UI mode
pnpm test:e2e:ui

# Run tests in debug mode
pnpm test:e2e:debug

# View the test report
pnpm test:e2e:report
```
